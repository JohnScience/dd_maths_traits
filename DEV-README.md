In order to allow the users to implement the traits provided by the crate on their structs, instead of generic impl block I think I have to implement the provided traits on the types I want via macro_rules. Then they can define a local trait, implement that trait on their structs and then provide a generic impl block that would implement any trait provided by the library for all types that implement their local trait.
